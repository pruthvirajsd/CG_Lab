Implement the following programs in C/C++ with OpenGL Libraries:

1. Write a program to generate a line using Bresenham’s line drawing technique. Consider slopes greater than one and slopes less than one. User must able to draw as many lines and specify inputs through keyboard/mouse.

2. Write a program to generate a circle and ellipse using Bresenham’s circle drawing and ellipse drawing techniques. Use two windows to draw circle in one window and ellipse in the other window. User can specify inputs through keyboard/mouse.

3. Write a program to recursively subdivides a tetrahedron to form 3D Sierpinski gasket. The number of recursive steps is to be specified at execution time.

4. Write a program to fill any given polygon using scan-line area filling algorithm.

5. Write a program to create a house like figure and perform the following operations. i. Rotate it about a given fixed point using OpenGL transformation functions. ii. Reflect it about an axis y=mx+c using OpenGL transformation functions.

6. Write a program to implement the Cohen-Sutherland line clipping algorithm. Make provision to specify the input for multiple lines, window for clipping and viewport for displaying the clipped image.

7. Write a program to implement the Liang-Barsky line clipping algorithm. Make provision to specify the input for multiple lines, window for clipping and viewport for displaying the clipped image.

8. Write a program to implement the Cohen-Hodgeman polygon clipping algorithm. Make provision to specify the input polygon and window for clipping.

9. Write a program to model a car like figure using display lists and move a car from one end of the screen to other end. User is able to control the speed with mouse.

10. Write a program to create a color cube and spin it using OpenGL transformations.

11. Create a menu with three entries named curves, colors and quit. The entry curves has a sub menu which has four entries namely Limacon, Cardiod, Three-Leaf, and Spiral. The color menu has sub menu with all eight colors of RGB color model. Write program to create the above hierarchical menu and attach appropriate services to each menu entries with mouse buttons.

12. Write a program to construct Bezier curve. Control points are supplied through keyboard/ mouse.
